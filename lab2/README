How to run program: 
**MacOS is necessary for compile**
make <algorithm you want to use for scheduler>
./<algorithm you want to use> <input.txt>
For example, if you wanted to run the FCFS algorithm, you would type "make fcfs" and then run it with "./fcfs input.txt"
Tests: 
FCFS tested by making sure the tasks run in the order in which they are scheduled in input file.
SJF tested by running tasks that have the shortest CPU burst.
Priority tested by running tasks with the highest priorities first.
RR tested by making sure each task is run for a QUANTUM amount of time -- if the remaining CPU burst is less than the QUANTUM then it will run for the remaining time and continue to the next task.
Priority_RR runs highest priority first. The tasks that are tied in priority will run in RR fashion.
